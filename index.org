And all the folks at my library at actually make the content for the screens.</aside>

* The 'Screens'
 #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (t)
 * 32" monitors embedded in walls and shelf ends   
 * 15 monitors at 5 branchs
 * Displayed Aspen Lists created by staff
#+BEGIN_NOTES
The hardware I am talking about today were actually all-in-one computers but for convience, I will refer to them as the 'screens'
1) 32" screens embedded in walls and shelf ends, portrait oriented.
2) 15 screens at 5 branches
3) Server styled Aspen Lists created by staff at those branches
#+END_NOTES
** The Problem
 #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (t)
 * Aloof administrators    
 * Finicky software
 * Broken workflows
#+BEGIN_NOTES
1) An administrator that no longer works at my library, subverted protocol and made a business relationship with a local avertising company. Because our normal procedures for on boarding new technology wasn't followed, chaos ensured.
2) This advertising company developed a bepoke content management system to server content to the screens. This pulled data from Aspen; namely, staff Lists.
3) There was perpetual confusion as to who was responsible for what. In short, their software stack was fragile, and whose responsibility it was to fix it was nebulous.  
 #+END_NOTES
** [[./images/display-1.jpeg]]
#+BEGIN_NOTES
What we would often end up with was this. A screen with nothing on it.

Here's what one of the screens looks like on a standard issue book cart. 

So that's the problem. What's the solution?
#+END_NOTES
** The Solution
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Aspen!

Specifically, Browse Categories
#+END_NOTES
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (t)
- Aspen!
- Specifically, Browse Categories
** [[./images/displays-2.jpg]] 
#+BEGIN_NOTES
This is what they look like now, embedded in the wall. This is directly across from our circulation desk at the Madison Branch.
+ What you see here are Browse Categories created from staff Lists.
+ They move automatically to next Browse Category after 20 seconds.
+ Staff have autonomy to create their own Categories from Lists or Searches.
+ And granular permissions to only update only the screens at their locations.
+ So how did we get here?
#+END_NOTES
* First steps
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (t) 
- Full screen, locked down
- [[https://www.kioware.com/][Kioware]]
- alternative: [[https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-enterprise-kiosk-mode][Firefox kiosk mode]]
#+BEGIN_NOTES
1) The old software had kiosk-like features that would launch the software in fullscreen mode and lock the touchscreen. We needed to find a replacement. 
2) Ultimately, we went with Kioware as this satisfied the security concerns of our IT department, and we were already using it on our OPACs. 
3) Depending on your circumstances, Firefox in kiosk mode could be a great free alternative.

- Q: How to scope content to a specific branch?
- A: Dummy locations for each piece of hardware
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Effected branches were accustomed to creating content specific to their branch. 
+ To achieve feature parity, in Aspen we created a dummy location; e.g., the Madison branch got a Location called Madison-Display.

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (t)
- Q: How to make Browse Categories automatically move 
- A: James Staub's [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M-mUy-G2Y8oI_AnwW4u9DrWyOyr3yBDmBRh4BaM9jnU][custom JavaScript]]
#+BEGIN_NOTES
The old software displayed covers as an animated scroll. We had to figure out a way for the Browse Categories move on their own. James Staub, our senior systems librarian, wrote a JavaScript snippet to automate the rotation of Browse Categories. The snippet causes the current Category to advance to the next Category after twenty seconds and refresh the page after reaching the last Category in the Group. The last part is very important because this is what enables staff to make changes from their workstations without have to touch the hardware itself which is difficult to access. When the page refreshes, their changes appear. The snippet: 
#+END_NOTES
** Move to next Category after X seconds
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (t)
#+BEGIN_SRC javascript :export code
if (location.pathname == '/') {
	var reloadURL = window.location.href;
	var rotateTime = 20000;
	var rotateCount = 0;
	function rotateCategory()
#+END_SRC
** Refresh after the last Category
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (t)
#+BEGIN_SRC javascript :export code
function rotateCategory() {
      var bccount = $('.jcarousel').jcarousel('items').length;
      var nextCategory = null;		
      nextCategory = $('[data-category-id='+AspenDiscovery.Browse.curCategory+']').next().attr('data-category-id');
      if (!nextCategory || rotateCount >= bccount - 1 ) { 
                          window.location.href = reloadURL;
      }
      rotateCount++;
      AspenDiscovery.Browse.changeBrowseCategory(nextCategory);
}
#+END_SRC

		var nextCategory = null;

* Granular Permissions
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (t)
[[./images/stapler.png]]
#+BEGIN_NOTES
We have a lot of Browse Categories at our library (probably too many). The Collections + Technology team manages the system-wide Browse Category Groups centrally. We didn't want anyone moving our stapler.

1) With the release of Aspen Discovery 23.06 we had the ability granularly assign permissions to specific staff members to edit only specific Browse Category Groups. This permission is called 'Administer Selected Browse Category Groups'.
#+END_NOTES
** Administer selected Browse Category Groups aka don't move my stapler
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (t)
[[./images/granular-permissions.png]]
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Here are the accounts that can edit the Madison-Display Browse Category Group. No one moves our stapler though maybe it would psychologically healthy if someone did.
#+END_NOTES
* Staff Training
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (t) 
- What's a 'Browse Category'?
- PDF instruction, video calls
- Positives and negatives 
#+BEGIN_NOTES 
I had to train staff to use the 'new platform'. 

1) The staff who were creating content with old system didn't know about Aspen Browse Categories. 

2) I created a document that walked them through the process of creating Browse Categories. The first link on the training document was the Aspen Help Center. Big thank you to everyone at built that resource. I also made myself available for video calls.

Positives:
- Some staff were really appreciative that their screens got fixed and there was a transparent chain of responsibility.

- Some staff are just poison-pilled on the topic of this hardware and the software that runs on it. Some too are just disappointed that functionality is a little different. For one, their lists would previously scroll in horizontal line like a Collection Spotlight. More on that later.
#+END_NOTES
* Future Steps
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (t) 
1) Info boxes
2) Patron navigation
3) Randomized covers
4) Use Web Builder (not Browse Categories)
#+BEGIN_NOTES  
1) We would like to be able to tap covers and get an info box about the title. (The old software did this)
2) Some way to have viewers navigate between categories
3) Randomized covers (let's all put tickets in about this)
4) Perhaps use Web Builder to serve the content instead of Browse Categories 
#+END_NOTES 
* Takeaways
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (t) 
- Follow procedures
- Learn to code
- Invest in a test server
- Know thyself, respect others
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Follow your procedures

If we worked fast this could have taken two-weeks, more realistically two months. But it took two years and this really caused me to evaluate why that was. There was a lot of introspection and a lot of analysis my team and my work environment. It definitely made me question if I wanted to continue in at my job.
