I am Bryan. I am a Systems Librarian at Nashville Public Library. Today, I am going to tell you about how Nashville Public Library repurposed digital signage to feature Browse Categories.<br><br>First, I want to thank everyone that helped put AspenCon together. Organizing an event like this a huge lift and I appreciate the work everyone is doing to make this happen.<br><br>Second, I want to note that though I am the person speaking here today, in truth the work was done by my colleages: Jenny Ellis (our web designer), James Staub (the senior Systems Librarian), Larry Jirik (our Intrastructure Manager), Thomas Hammonds (our Applications Analyst), and the devs at ByWater. And all the folks at my library at actually make the content for the screens.</aside>

We have a lot of Browse Categories at our library (probably too many). The Collections + Technology team manages the system-wide Browse Category Groups centrally. We didn't want anyone moving our stapler.

<ol>
<li>With the release of Aspen Discovery 23.06 we had the ability granularly assign permissions to specific staff members to edit only specific Browse Category Groups. This permission is called 'Administer Selected Browse Category Groups'.</li>

Here are the accounts that can edit the Madison-Display Browse Category Group. No one moves our stapler though maybe it would psychologically healthy if someone did.

<ul>

<p>
I had to train staff to use the 'new platform'. 
</p>

<ol>
<li>The staff who were creating content with old system didn't know about Aspen Browse Categories.</li>

<li>I created a document that walked them through the process of creating Browse Categories. The first link on the training document was the Aspen Help Center. Big thank you to everyone at built that resource. I also made myself available for video calls.</li>

</ol>

<p>
Positives:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Some staff were really appreciative that their screens got fixed and there was a transparent chain of responsibility.</li>

<li>Some staff are just poison-pilled on the topic of this hardware and the software that runs on it. Some too are just disappointed that functionality is a little different. For one, their lists would previously scroll in horizontal line like a Collection Spotlight. More on that later.</li>
